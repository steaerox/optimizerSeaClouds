Optimization module for applications with quality constraints in a multicloud environment
link to the Official page of the main project: http://www.seaclouds-project.eu

Before starting import there are few things to know:
- This project is done for my master thesis
- This project is a part of the european project linked above.
- Some classes are duplicated such as Optimizer and OptimizerNew (the newest one), so please take a look (and be careful) before importing and merge with ohter parts.

Secondly
In order to visualize some Class-Activity Diagram install:
- AmaterasUML (i.e. sqd extension file)
or
-ObjectAid UML Diagram (i.e. ucls extension file)

To have a working project please link the "optimizer-core/src/main/resources/jmetal4.5.src" source folder at your Java Build Path of your project.
Some classes from the original source are a little bit modified.

To see the original source and Manuals visit: http://jmetal.sourceforge.net


I would like to say a special thank to my Assistant and my Professor helping me realize this.
